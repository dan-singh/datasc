Linear Regression is a way to minimize interceptual distance between plotted data points as compared to predicted or fitted line. There can be 2 types of linear regression 
 a. Simple Linear Regression: Here we have simple formula which is y = mx + c 
 b. Multiple Linear Regression: here mult variates are included in equation as 
 Yij = C0j + C1j*Xi1 + C2j*Xi2 + .. + Cpj*Xp1  + Eij 
 
 
 Goodness of fit can be determined by any of the following methods:
  a) R squared coefficient
  b) Adjusted R squared
  c) Standard Error
  d) F and T statistics
